# Pet Names Web App

This web app will allow the user to simply click a button and a randomly generated pet name will show. The user can chose between a male or female name.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- React

### Local Setup
**Note**: Skip this section if running docker compose on the entire app.

1. Clone project: `git clone git@github.com:JaxTurboNerd/Jax-Pet-Names.git`
2. Navigate into folder: `cd Jax-Pet-Names/client`
3. Add `.env` file with `REACT_APP_HOST` set to your host URL. This will be `http://localhost:3001` when using the local backend server.
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
6. Start just front end: `npm run start`
7. Usually you need the backend running locally along with the front end. To start both at the same time, navigate to the root folder (`cd ..`) and run: `npm run app:start`
